### Rotating Internal self signed certificateThis feature allows users to automatically update/rotate NeuVector internal certificates.

After enabled, a newly added init-container of controller pod will create a Kubernetes Job resource to perform internal certificate's rotation. The upgrader job can also be triggered via a CronJob object, so internal certificate will be rotated regularly.

This feature is enabled by default, but it will not rotate certificate in upgrade scenario. To enable auto-rotation, internal.autoRotateCert has to be enabled. (disabled by default).

#### Expected behavior when internal.autoRotateCert is enabled
##### Fresh install

1. When all containers start running, controller's init containers will run and create an upgrader job.

2. The upgrader will run and initialize new internal secret. In the mean time, components are waiting for the secret being initialized.

3. After internal secret is initialized, all components read the secret and go through the normal flow.
